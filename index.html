							The Bit Inspector Tool provides information on all possible features associated with
							individual bits that either appear or do not appear in a given bitstream for programming
							FPGAs. This tool relies on the Symbiflow Project X-Ray database and is compatible with all
							devices that the database supports. Below is a flow chart of how this tool is used.

						</div>
						<p>
							With Xilinx's Vivado Design Suite, a string of bits can be created from a SystemVerilog
							design to program an FPGA for a specific purpose. Each bit is associated with a "feature"
							related to some element in the FPGA (flip-flops, muxes, interconnects, etc.) In some
							circumstances (such as in satellite applications), FPGAs are prone to radiation-induced
							faults that will "flip" bits to incorrect values. With this tool, more can be understood
							about what happens when these faults occur.
						</p>
						<p>
							By using a .bits file (a human readable file that shows each bit set to "1" on separate
							lines) to select certain bit locations and a normal bitstream file used to program an FPGA,
							this tool can show every feature that each bit in the .bits file affects (whether in the
							actual design or not) and whether it is found in the original bitstream.
						</p>
						<p>
							I built upon pre-existing Project X-Ray tools that utilize open source FPGA databases, and
							used Python to create this tool. I wrote documentation and created an easy to follow demo
							intended to help someone with minimal knowledge of Linux terminal commands and FPGA
							programming to be able to use this tool. I created this tool as a Research Assistant at BYU
							and it is only available on a private GitHub repository.

							The Femto-Satellite (femto- refers to the unit prefix denoting a factor of 10<sup>-15</sup>)
							is a small satellite that can record several different motion and atmospheric measurements
							and send them back to a base station by radio. I worked on this project with a fellow BYU
							student as a part of the BYU Spacecraft Group. We worked side-by-side, collaberating on
							every step of the process. </p>
						<p>
							We started by choosing the different modules that we would use to take measurements, as well
							as a radio module to send the data. We chose the 9-axis MPU-9250 TDK InvenSense for motion,
							the BME280 by Bosch Sensortech for atmospheric measurements, and the RFM69 for radio
							communication. </p>

							During the design process we used a breadboard and breakoutboards for each module to create
							and test the software required for the satellite. We had to read through documentation for
							each module and choose the features/functions that would best fit out needs. At a 9600
							baudrate, we sent 30 character packets (for simplicity reasons) with data from the different
							modules to a radio base station provided by the club. </p>
						<p>
							To create the custom PCB, we used EAGLE. After several iterations, we were able to fit all
							of the modules on a board sized 22mm x 70mm. We used placed solder paste on the appropriate
							surfaces on the PCB using a stencil, and after placing our modules and various components on
							the PCB, we used a reflow oven to join everything. </p>

							This is a touch-screen version of the classic Whack-A-Mole game. In the game, moles pop out
							of holes and your job is to “whack” them by touching the screen before they go back into
							their hole. The game gets progressively harder, including faster movement from the moles,
							and multiple moles appearing at the same time. By using the switches on the board, the user
							can choose between four, six, and nine mole modes. Once a certain amount of moles are
							missed, the game ends, and the score is shown at the end.

							The game was developed in two parts: the display, and the control. The display code is

							analog-to-digital converters to settle, and sending those coordinates to the display code to
							determine what needs to be drawn/erased on the screen.

							I used graphic routines provided by the Adafruit LCD display library, and created low-level

							This is a version of pong designed for both the Digilent Nexys 4 and the Basys 3 FPGA
							boards. Both players control their paddles with the buttons on the board and hit the ball
							back and forth. If a player fails to return the ball, the other player earns a point, and
							their score is updated on the board's built-in seven segment display.

							The game was created with a module to draw the ball, a module to draw the paddles, as well
							as a module to handle the ball movement, player input, and to update the score. These
							modules, in conjunction with a bitmap to VGA module and seven segment display module
							provided by BYU, make up all the circuitry for this project. With a constraints file mapping
							the I/O signals to the correct pins, the game is ready to be played.
